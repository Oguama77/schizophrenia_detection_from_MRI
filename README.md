## Schizophrenia Classification from Magnetic Resonance Images

### Overview
This project focuses on exploring the effect of various preprocessing and data augmentation methods on the accuracy of schizophrenia detection from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. The aim of this exploration is to address the existing ambiguity in how MR images are preprocessed before training, as most authors in literature perform preprocessing in MATLAB without clear instructions for reproducibility.

### Project Data
The raw data were obtained from the [SchizConnect](http://schizconnect.org/) database. The data obtained originates from the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) dataset in NifTI format and represents structural MR images. In the framework of the present study, the data was sampled to give a balanced representation of age and gender distributions in the dataset, prioritizing age distribution, which has been shown to affect model performance. Overall, the project includes data from 62 individuals, 30 with schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls.

### Project Workflow
[Data Loading](src/utils/data_loader.py) >> [Data Exploration](src/utils/eda.py) >> [Preprocessing](src/utils/preprocess.py) >> [Validating Preprocessing Output](src/utils/preprocess_validation.py) >> [Augmentation](src/utils/augmentations.py) >> [Feature Extraction](src/models/cnn.py) & [Classification](src/models/svm.py) >> [Visualizing training results](src/utils/plot_svm_metrics.py)

&check; Data Exploration: assessed demographic features and gender/age distributions;

&check; Preprocessing & Augmentation: experimented with different combinations of preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to determine which pipeline yields the best performance of the ML/DL models;

&check; Feature Extraction & Classification: harnessed ResNet-18 to extract features and SVC to classify them;

&check; Visualization: obtained classifier metrics and compared results across experiments.
